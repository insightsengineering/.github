      placeholder: Steps to create a release.
      value: |
        - [ ] Make sure that CI checks are passing in GH before releasing he package.
        - [ ] Update NEWS.md file: make sure it reflects a holistic summary of what has changed in the package.
        - [ ] Remove the additional fields (`Remotes`) from the DESCRIPTION file where applicable.
        - [ ] Increase versioned dependency on {package name} to >=X.X.X (Optional).
        - [ ] Make sure that the minimum dependency versions are updated in the DESCRIPTION file for the package and its reverse dependencies (Optional).
        - [ ] Commit your changes and create the PR on GitHub (add "[skip vbump]" in the PR title). Add all updates, commit, and push changes:
          # Create a new release candidate branch 
          git checkout -b release-candidate-vX.Y.Z
          # Make the necessary modifications to your files
          # Stage the changes
          git add <files your modified>
          # Commit the changes
          git commit -m "[skip vbump] <Your commit message>"
          git push origin release-candidate-vX.Y.Z
        - [ ] Tag the update(s) as a release candidate vX.Y.Z-rc<iteration-number> (e.g. v0.5.3-rc1) on the release candidate branch (release-candidate-vX.Y.Z).
          # Create rc tag for submission for internal validation
          git tag vX.Y.Z-rc<iteration number>
          git push origin vX.Y.Z-rc<iteration number>
        - [ ] Build the package locally using the command:`R CMD build .` which will generate a .tar.gz file necessary for the CRAN submission.
        - [ ] Submit the package that was build in the previous step via this form: https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html.
        - [ ] Address CRAN feedback, tag the package vX.X.X-rc(n+1) and repeat the submission to CRAN whenever necessary.
        - [ ] Get the package accepted and published on CRAN.
        - [ ] If the additional fields were removed, add them back in a separate PR, and then merge the PR back to main (add "[skip vbump]" in the PR title). If nothing was removed just merge the PR you created at the beginning of this section.
        - [ ] Create a git tag with the final version set to vX.Y.Z on the main branch. In order to do this:
          1. Merge the release-candidate-vX.Y.Z branch into main.
          2. Note the commit hash of the merged commit. Note that additional commits might be added to the main branch by a bot or an automation - we do NOT want to tag this commit.
          3. Checkout the commit hash.
          git checkout <commit hash>
          4. Tag the hash with the release version (vX.Y.Z).
          git tag vX.Y.Z
          5. Push the tag to make the final release.
          git push origin vX.Y.Z
